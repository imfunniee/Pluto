# Pluto
a peer to peer video and text chat


### Why?
idk

### Usage 
- Allow camera
- Copy your id and send it to peer 2 or your friend (idk how) and tell your friend to paste it in "other id" textarea and hit connect to genreate their id
- Tell your friend to give you their id, once you got your firends id paste it in "other id" textarea
- Hit Connect

ðŸŽ‰ You should see your friend on the right hand side

#1 in the url makes you peer1/person 1 and the other person/your firend peer2 so ye tell your firend to open up the site without "#1" in url

### Testing

To test this, open https://imfunniee.github.io/pluto#1 in a tab and https://imfunniee.github.io/pluto/ in another tab


### Warning - The unique ids have your ip in them, so ye don't go around on internet sharing the ids (trust your friends and family only)
