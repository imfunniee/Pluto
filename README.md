# Pluto
a peer to peer video and text chat 

idk why i made this but ye i saw a youtube video on internet and thought it would be a nice project lol

### Usage 
- Allow camera
- copy your id and send it to peer2/your friend
- Paste your friend's id in "other id" textarea
- You should see your friend on the right hand side

#1 in the url makes you peer1/person 1 and the other person/your firend peer2 so ye tell your firend to open up the site without "#1" in url

### Testing

To test this, open https://imfunniee.github.io/pluto#1 in a tab and https://imfunniee.github.io/pluto/ in another tab


### Warning - The unique ids have your ip in them, so ye don't go around on internet sharing the ids (trust your friends and family only)
